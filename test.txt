And then my boss will get upset because I have earbuds in but I can't play music out loud because I'm trying to be considerate of other people. Unlike my cubicle mate, the guy the other cubicle, then, you know, that's just like one example. And then like, when I'm driving home, there was this guy walking his dog on the side of the road, and like there's no shoulder so it's not a safe place. So, like, I just feel like he's risking his life and his dog's life and my life. I get home and I kept thinking about it.
